# Henry the sailor lives on island of an archipelago. All islands including archipelago are so small that
# they can be represented as points in R^2 space. The positions of all islands are given as the sequence
# W = ((x1, y1), ..., (xn, yn)). Henry lives on the island (x1, y1), but he wants to move to the island
# (xn, yn). Normally every day he can sail to an island that is at most Z distance (in standard Euclidean
# distance). He can also sail up to 2Z distance, provided that he will rest all the next day. Henry
# always must stay overnight on some island. Find minimum number of days Henry needs to get to his
# target island (or states that it is impossible).
